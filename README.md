This repository contains projects completed under the guidance of the Big Data Analytics course. 
The projects, both individual and collaborative, leverage Apache Spark in Python to perform extensive big data analysis. 
By integrating SQL and various machine learning algorithms, we aim to extract valuable insights and perform advanced data processing tasks.
